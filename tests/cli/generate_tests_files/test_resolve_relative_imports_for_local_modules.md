# Test Plan: Convert Imports Function

## Overview

from tools.cli.generate_test_files._generate_test_files._resolve_relative_imports_for_local_modules import parse_relative_import

This document outlines comprehensive test plans for the `convert_imports` function that converts between absolute and relative imports in Python files. The function was refactored from a command-line tool to provide a clean programmatic interface.

## Test Structure Overview

```
TEST SUITE: convert_imports_function_tests
    SETUP:
        - Create temporary directory structure for test files
        - Define helper functions for file creation and content verification
        - Set up mock file systems with various Python package structures
    
    TEARDOWN:
        - Clean up all temporary files and directories
        - Reset any modified global state
```

## Test Execution Strategy

### Priority Levels
1. **Critical**: Basic conversion functionality, error handling
2. **High**: Edge cases, file handling, batch processing
3. **Medium**: Performance, real-world scenarios
4. **Low**: Advanced integration scenarios

### Test Environment Requirements
- Temporary file system access
- Multiple Python package structures
- Permission manipulation capabilities
- Concurrent execution testing framework

### Coverage Goals
- **Line Coverage**: 95%+ for core functionality
- **Branch Coverage**: 90%+ for all conditional logic
- **Edge Case Coverage**: 100% for documented edge cases

## Notes

This comprehensive test suite covers all major functionality, edge cases, error conditions, and real-world scenarios that the `convert_imports` function should handle correctly. Each test should be implemented with proper setup, execution, and teardown phases to ensure test isolation and repeatability.
