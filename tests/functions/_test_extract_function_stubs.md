# Test plans for `extract_function_stubs` function.

## Docstring:
Extract function stubs from a Python file.

Parses a Python file to identify all callable definitions and extracts
their signatures, type hints, and docstrings to create function stubs.

Args:
    file_path (str): Path to the Python file to analyze.

Returns:
    List[Dict[str, Any]]: A list of dictionaries, each containing:
        - 'name' (str): The function/class name
        - 'signature' (str): Complete function signature with type hints
        - 'docstring' (Optional[str]): The function's docstring if present
        - 'is_async' (bool): Whether the function is an async function
        - 'is_method' (bool): Whether the function is a class method
        - 'class_name' (Optional[str]): Name of containing class if is_method is True

Raises:
    FileNotFoundError: If the specified file does not exist.
    PermissionError: If the file cannot be read due to permission issues.
    SyntaxError: If the Python file contains syntax errors.
    ValueError: If the file_path is empty or invalid.
    OSError: If there are other file system related errors.

Example:
    >>> stubs = extract_function_stubs('my_module.py')
    >>> for stub in stubs:
    ...     print(f"Function: {stub['name']}")
    ...     print(f"Signature: {stub['signature']}")
    ...     if stub['docstring']:
    ...         print(f"Docstring: {stub['docstring'][:50]}...")
    >>> # Example usage in a script:
    >>> stubs = extract_function_stubs('./src/utils.py')
    >>> async_funcs = [s for s in stubs if s['is_async']]
