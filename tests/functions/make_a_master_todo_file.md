    """Create a master TODO file from all Python files in a directory.

    Scans a directory for Python files and generates a hierarchical TODO list 
    containing all classes, methods, and functions found. The list includes 
    checkboxes for tracking completion of documentation, testing, and 
    implementation tasks for each callable.

    Args:
        directory_path (str): Path to the directory containing Python files to analyze.
                  Must be a valid directory path.
        output_path (str): Path where the master TODO file will be saved.
                  Must be a valid markdofn file path where the user has write permissions.

    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If the specified directory does not exist.
        PermissionError: If the directory cannot be accessed due to permissions.
        ValueError: If the directory path is invalid or contains no Python files.

    Returns:
        str: A path to a markdown file containing:
            - Directory header with the analyzed path
            - Generation timestamp
            - Hierarchical TODO list with checkboxes for:
                * Each Python file
                * Each class within files
                * Each method within classes
                * Each standalone function
                * Sub-tasks for docstrings, tests, and implementation

    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If the specified directory does not exist.
        PermissionError: If the directory cannot be accessed due to permissions.
        ValueError: If the directory path is invalid or contains no Python files.

    Example:
        >>> todo_path = _make_a_master_todo_list("/path/to/project", "/path/to/project/master_todo_list.md")
        >>> print(f"TODO list created at: {todo_path}")
        TODO list created at: /path/to/project/master_todo_list.md
